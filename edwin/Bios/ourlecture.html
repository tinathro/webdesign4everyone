Samsung's attorney stated,<br /> "This is a case not where we're disputing that the 13 phones contain some elements of Apple's property,<br />" but the company disputed the US$379.8 million amount that Apple claimed<br /> that it is owed in the wake of Samsung's admission Samsung presented a figure of US$52 million.<br />
On November 21, 2013 the jury awarded a new figure of US$290 million.<br /> The following devices were the concern of the retrial: Captivate, Continuum,<br /> Droid Charge, Epic 4G, Exhibit 4G, Galaxy Prevail, Galaxy Tab, Gem,<br /> Indulge, Infuse 4G, Nexus S 4G, Replenish, and Transform.
